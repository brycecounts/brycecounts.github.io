        <p>I am an interdisciplinary researcher in the area of overlap between philosophy of science, AI, and computational neuroscience. I am currently exploring the role that invariance plays in gradient systems (neural networks) under the assumption that gradient mechanisms are a cornerstone of intelligence/cognition. I am trying to develop models and explanations within the framework of mechanistic interpretability (MI). My primary goal is to explore what has been called the space of intelligences, and I think a first step in this process is understanding where our class of cognitive system is located admist potential neighboring regions. Investigating these topics has given me a strong interest in the philosophy of biology, applied mathematics and information geometry. </p>
